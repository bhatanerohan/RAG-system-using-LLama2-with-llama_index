# RAG-system-using-LLama2-with-llama_index

    Setup:
        Installation of necessary Python packages like pypdf, transformers, einops, accelerate, langchain, bitsandbytes, and various llama_index related packages. These are foundational libraries that provide support for PDF manipulation, machine learning models, and efficient data handling.

    Embedding Installation:
        Further installation of packages focusing on embeddings, specifically sentence_transformers and updates to llama_index.

    Code Imports and Environment Setup:
        The code imports various classes and functions from the llama_index package and sets up directory readers, service contexts, and prompt templates which are crucial for handling documents and setting up the model environment.

    Document Loading:
        Loading documents from a specified directory. These documents are likely used as the knowledge base for the RAG system.

    Model Configuration:
        Configuration of the Llama2 model with specific settings for prompt structure and tokenizer details. There is an emphasis on setting the context window, maximum token generation, and device optimization for computational efficiency.

    Embedding Setup:
        Configuration of embeddings using the LangchainEmbedding class which wraps HuggingFaceEmbeddings. This setup is crucial for the retrieval aspect of the RAG system, where embeddings are used to find relevant context for generating responses.

    Service Context Configuration:
        Setting up a service context that defines how chunks of text are processed and integrated with the machine learning model and embeddings.

    Index Creation:
        Creation of a vector store index from the loaded documents, which is essentially building a searchable database of information that can be queried efficiently.

    Query Engine Setup:
        Conversion of the index into a query engine, which can then be used to handle and respond to specific questions.

    Query Handling:
        Using the query engine to respond to various questions like healthcare proposals, event descriptions, and types of diabetes discussed in the texts. This demonstrates the retrieval and generation capabilities of the system.
